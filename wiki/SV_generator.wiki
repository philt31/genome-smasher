= SV_generator.sh =

SV_generator. sh is a useful shell script that calls several perl scripts that help to generate structural variations to insert into a synthetic genome.  

= Usage =

{{{
Usage: SV_Generator.sh <SCRIPTS_DIR> <Genome_DIR> <OUTPUT_VCF> <NUM_BASES_FASTAFILE_EACHLINE>"
}}}

The inputs are defined below:

 * SCRIPTS_DIR
  * The scripts directory is the full path to a series of perl scripts that will generate different types of structural variations:
   # Copy_number_changes.pl
   # Inversions.pl
   # Large_Deletions.pl
   # Novel_insertions.pl
   # Translocations.pl

 * Genome_DIR
  * The scripts directory is a directory that contains chromosome files for an individual reference genome assembly.  They must be stored by chromosome, beginning with "chr" and ending with ".fa".

 * OUTPUT_VCF
  * This is the name of the final vcf-like file to create

 * NUM_BASES_FASTAFILE_EACHLINE
  * some FAST files are 60 nucleotides long, whereas others are 50.  Make sure to select the corresponding length for your reference FASTA file inputs.

== Special Notes ==
No mutations will be added if the nucleotide where the event is being inserted is "N".
