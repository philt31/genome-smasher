*GenomeSmasher* is a set of tools used to create diploid fasta files with containing snps, indels, duplications, deletions, and translocations. These FASTA files can then be used in conjunction with next-gen sequencing simulators to artificially create sequencing experiments. The utitlity of these tools are to assess the performance and reliability of data analysis in next-gen sequencing pipelines.
